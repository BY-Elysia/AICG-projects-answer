# AICG Projects

## Introduction

AICG Projects extends [CG-projects](https://github.com/syby119/CG-projects) with assignments in computer graphics and AI for Graphics. The curriculum has two traditional rendering projects and two AI-focused projects. Students implement core graphics techniques from first principles, then explore how learned models can support modeling and scene reconstruction.

The traditional rendering projects cover:

- Rasterization on the CPU and GPU.
- Ray tracing on the CPU and GPU.

The AI for Graphics projects cover:

- Turning natural-language requests into editable CAD models with an agent that checks and revises its results.
- Reconstructing a self-captured scene with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), then planning and simulating robot navigation within it.

Each project calls for visual inspection and measurable tests of its results.

Projects 1 and 2 are independent CMake applications. Each requires Git, CMake 3.20 or newer, a C++20 compiler and standard library with `std::format`, an OpenGL 4.1 capable graphics environment, and [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) for its dependencies. Configure and build them separately; there is no repository-wide build. Their linked guides provide setup commands and runtime controls.

Projects 3 and 4 provide assignment specifications and example images. Their guides cover the required workflow, validation, and submissions.
